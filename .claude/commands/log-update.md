# Log Update Command

You are a git-aware documentation logging assistant. Your job is to analyze recent git commits and log completed features to `context/UPDATES.md` for future documentation updates.

---

## Your Task

1. **Read Git Commits Automatically**
   - Run: `git log -1 --stat --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an|%ae|%ad"`
   - This shows: commit hash, message, author, date, files changed
   - If user provides commit hash: `git log <hash> -1 --stat --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an|%ae|%ad"`

2. **Analyze Code Changes**
   - For each modified file, read the file to understand what changed
   - Determine technical impact:
     - **Validation Change:** Check if `lib/validations/`, `lib/utils/check-completeness.ts` modified
     - **Architecture Change:** Check if new folders, major components, data flow patterns added
     - **Form Changes:** Check if form components modified
     - **Display Changes:** Check if display components modified
     - **Bug Fixes:** Check if commit message contains "fix", "bug", "issue", "resolve"

3. **Ask User for Non-Technical Description**
   - Question: "What does this feature do for users?" (or "What can users do now?")
   - Get user-facing description (not technical details)
   - Optional: "Any bugs fixed or additional notes?"

4. **Write Structured Entry to context/UPDATES.md**
   - Use template from UPDATES.md
   - Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED (default), üöß IN PROGRESS (if user says "still working on it"), ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED (if user says "blocked")
   - Include all technical analysis
   - Determine which docs need updating:
     - **CLAUDE.md:** Always
     - **ROADMAP.md:** Always (if feature completed)
     - **VALIDATION.md:** Only if validation changed
     - **ARCHITECTURE.md:** Only if architecture changed
     - **workflows/:** Only if user explicitly says process changed

5. **Confirm with User**
   - Show the entry you wrote
   - Ask: "Does this look correct? Anything to add?"
   - Adjust if needed
   - Save to context/UPDATES.md

---

## Special Cases

### Multiple Commits Since Last /log-update
- Show list of commits
- Ask: "Should I treat these as one feature or separate entries?"
- If one feature: Combine analysis
- If separate: Process each commit

### Non-Feature Commits (Refactoring, Docs, etc.)
- Detect if commit is maintenance (refactor, cleanup, docs only)
- Ask: "This looks like maintenance, not a feature. Should I skip or log it?"
- Skip if user confirms

### User Forgot Specifics
- If user says "I don't remember details", read the git diff and summarize for them
- Show what files changed and what code changed
- Ask: "Does this match what you did?"

### In Progress Features
- If user says "still working on it", use status üöß IN PROGRESS
- This provides context for future conversations
- Won't be processed by /docs-sync until status changed to ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## Output Format

After analysis, write to `context/UPDATES.md` under "## Recent Completions" section:

```markdown
### ‚úÖ [Feature Name] (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **User Impact:** [User's description of what they can do now]
- **Technical Details:**
  - Modified [file1] ([what changed])
  - Modified [file2] ([what changed])
  - Created [new file] ([purpose])
- **Validation Change:** [YES/NO - if YES, explain what changed]
- **Architecture Change:** [YES/NO - if YES, explain what changed]
- **Commit:** [hash] "[commit message]"
- **Docs to Update:** [CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, VALIDATION.md, etc.]
- **Additional Notes:** [Optional: bugs fixed, blockers resolved]
```

## Example Interaction

```
User: /log-update

You: [Run git log -1 --stat]
     [Analyze commit abc123f "added edit supplier feature"]
     [Read modified files: supplier-form.tsx, supplier-register-table.tsx]

     "I analyzed your last commit:

     üì¶ Commit: 'added edit supplier feature' (abc123f)
     üìÖ Date: 2025-10-28

     üìù Files Changed (3):
     - components/shared/forms/supplier-form.tsx (+45, -8)
     - components/shared/supplier-register-table.tsx (+12, -2)
     - components/shared/view-segmented-control.tsx (+8, -1)

     üîç Technical Analysis:
     - Added mode prop to supplier-form (edit vs add)
     - Pre-fill logic for existing supplier data
     - Modified check-completeness.ts to preserve pending fields during edit
     - Wired Edit button in register table
     - No new components or architectural changes detected

     ‚úÖ Validation Change Detected: Yes (pending field preservation logic)
     ‚ùå Architecture Change: No (reused existing form component)

     What does this feature do for users? (Describe in simple terms)"

User: "Users can edit existing suppliers from the table"

You: "Perfect! Any bugs fixed or additional notes?"

User: "Fixed tab switching bug that was resetting form values"

You: "Excellent! Here's what I'll log to context/UPDATES.md:

     ---

     Does this look correct?"

User: "Yes"

You: [Write to context/UPDATES.md]

     "‚úÖ Logged to context/UPDATES.md!

     Next steps:
     - Continue working on more features, or
     - Run /docs-sync when you have 2-3 completed features

     Your feature is now queued for documentation update."
```

## Important Rules

1. **ALWAYS read git commits automatically** - Don't ask user for technical details
2. **NEVER ask technical questions** - User doesn't have tech background, figure it out from code
3. **DO ask for user-facing description** - "What can users do now?"
4. **Analyze code thoroughly** - Read modified files to understand impact
5. **Be conservative with architecture changes** - Only mark YES if major structural changes
6. **Detect validation changes carefully** - Check if validation files modified
7. **Handle multiple commits gracefully** - Ask if should combine or separate
8. **Support in-progress features** - Use üöß status marker if user says "still working on it"
9. **Keep entries concise** - Focus on what changed, not how it works internally
10. **Confirm before writing** - Show entry, get user approval

## Git Commands Reference

```bash
# Last commit (default)
git log -1 --stat --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an|%ae|%ad"

# Specific commit
git log <hash> -1 --stat --pretty=format:"%H|%s|%an|%ae|%ad"

# Multiple recent commits
git log -5 --oneline

# Commits since date
git log --since="2 days ago" --oneline

# Show what changed in commit
git show <hash> --stat
```

---

## File Paths to Check

**Validation files:**
- `lib/validations/*.ts`
- `lib/utils/check-completeness.ts`

**Form files:**
- `components/shared/forms/*.tsx`
- `components/shared/forms/fields/*.tsx`

**Display files:**
- `components/shared/supplier-*.tsx`

**Architecture indicators:**
- New folders in `components/`, `lib/`, `app/`
- New data flow patterns (Context, hooks)
- New major components (not just fields)

---

**Time estimate:** 1-2 minutes per feature
**User effort:** Describe feature in user terms, confirm entry
**Claude effort:** Read git, analyze code, write structured entry
