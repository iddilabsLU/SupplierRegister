# Completed Documentation Updates Archive

**Purpose:** This file archives all features that have been processed by `/docs-sync` and incorporated into main documentation. It serves as a permanent project history.

**Archive Started:** 2025-10-28

---

## How This Works

1. User completes feature â†’ Runs `/log-update` â†’ Entry added to UPDATES.md
2. User accumulates 2-3 features â†’ Runs `/docs-sync`
3. Claude processes entries â†’ Updates CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, etc.
4. Claude moves processed entries here with timestamp
5. UPDATES.md is cleared (except in-progress items)

This file grows over time and provides:
- Complete project history
- Reference for what was built when
- Context for understanding documentation changes
- Audit trail of feature completions

---

## Archive Format

Entries are organized by sync date (when documentation was updated), not feature completion date.

```
## Documentation Sync: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Features Processed:** [count]
- **Documentation Updated:** [files updated]
- **Sync Duration:** [time taken]

[Feature entries moved from UPDATES.md]
```

### âœ… SessionStorage Data Persistence (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Changes to suppliers (add, edit, delete) now persist when refreshing the page. Data survives refreshes during the session but resets to default when the browser tab is closed, providing a clean demo experience.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Created `lib/utils/session-storage.ts` (save/load/clear supplier utilities)
  - Created `hooks/use-session-storage.ts` (React hook with automatic persistence on state changes)
  - Created `components/shared/demo-banner.tsx` (dismissible banner explaining demo mode)
  - Modified `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (integrated useSessionStorage hook)
  - Modified `components/shared/supplier-register-table.tsx` (changed table hint banner from localStorage to sessionStorage for consistency)
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (added utility layer, no structural changes)
- **Commit:** a01dffb4 "feature: Add sessionStorage data persistence for supplier register"
- **Docs Updated:** CLAUDE.md (added to What Works), ROADMAP.md (marked as Done)

### âœ… Delete Supplier Functionality (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Users can now delete suppliers from the register table. Clicking the delete button shows a confirmation dialog with supplier details, and upon confirmation, the supplier is permanently removed from the list. Changes persist across page refreshes during the session.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Added `handleDeleteSupplier` function in `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (filters suppliers by reference number)
  - Wired `onDelete` prop to `SupplierRegisterTable` component
  - Fixed toast notification in `components/shared/supplier-register-table.tsx` (moved outside if/else to always show)
  - Delete functionality integrates with existing sessionStorage persistence (auto-saves)
  - Confirmation dialog and toast notification already existed, just needed wiring
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (used existing UI components and state patterns)
- **Commit:** 813d3ca "feature: Implement delete supplier functionality"
- **Docs Updated:** CLAUDE.md (added to What Works), ROADMAP.md (marked as Done)

### âœ… Instant Duplicate Supplier (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Users can now instantly duplicate any supplier by clicking the Duplicate button. A new supplier is created with an auto-generated reference number, Draft status, and all original fields preserved (including dates and pending fields). A toast notification confirms the action.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Added `handleDuplicateSupplier` function in `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (clones supplier data, generates new reference, sets status to Draft)
  - Added `toast` import from sonner library
  - Wired `onDuplicate` prop to `SupplierRegisterTable` component
  - Duplicate is added directly to suppliers array (no form redirect, stays on register list)
  - Toast notification shows: "Supplier duplicated - Created {newRef} based on {originalRef}"
  - Changes auto-persist via sessionStorage
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (reused existing patterns and state management)
- **Commit:** 778f14b "feature: Implement instant duplicate supplier functionality"
- **Docs Updated:** CLAUDE.md (added to What Works), ROADMAP.md (marked as Done)

  - Created `lib/utils/export-formatters.ts` (data transformation utilities for dates, booleans, arrays)
  - Integrated export button into `supplier-register-table.tsx` toolbar
  - Added `xlsx` package for Excel generation
  - Added `jspdf` + `jspdf-autotable` dependencies (for future PDF export)
  - Smart handling: Pending fields marked with `*`, Cloud/Critical fields show "N/A" when not applicable, arrays formatted with commas/pipes
  - **Added "Activities are sub-outsourced" field (Yes/No toggle) for critical suppliers:**
    - Added `hasSubOutsourcing` boolean to 9 files (types, validation, form, display, export mapping, completeness check)
    - Replaced plain Switch with proper FormRadioGroup in critical form
    - Updated field count from 51â†’52 fields (21 critical fields now)
    - Toggle controls whether subcontractor array fields are shown/required
- **Validation Change:** YES - Added `hasSubOutsourcing` validation logic (checks toggle first, then subcontractor array if Yes)
- **Architecture Change:** NO - New export utilities added, but no major structural changes
- **Commit:** 54b67be 'Feature implemented: export excel function both compact and full view, phase 1 - 3 of the exprotfunctionplan.md.'
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, VALIDATION.md
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Tested and working with no bugs found
  - Part of `ExportFunctionPlan.md` implementation (Phase 1-3 complete)
  - Phase 4-5 (PDF export) pending - button placeholder exists in dialog
  - ARCHITECTURE.md already updated in commit with export section

### âœ… PDF Export Functionality (2025-10-31)
- **User Impact:** Users can now export the supplier register to PDF (compact/summary view only with 8 columns). Combined with Excel export, users now have 3 export options:
  - **Excel Compact** - Summary export with 8 key columns
  - **Excel Full** - Complete export with all 52 CSSF fields
  - **PDF Compact** - Professional summary PDF with 8 columns (landscape, headers, page numbers)
  - All formats support exporting filtered results
- **Technical Details:**

  - Modified `export-dialog.tsx` (added PDF functionality, loading states, UX polish)
  - Professional PDF formatting: landscape orientation, blue headers, striped rows, page numbers, export date
  - Loading spinner during export prevents double-clicks
  - Button text changes to "Exporting..." with animated Loader2 icon
  - Helper text guides users when incompatible options selected
  - PDF button disabled when "Full export" format selected (full PDF intentionally removed - layout too messy for 52 fields)
  - All edge cases handled with proper error messages and toast notifications
- **Validation Change:** NO - No validation logic changed
- **Architecture Change:** NO - Added new utility file, no structural changes
- **Commit:** 37789e5 'feat: implement PDF export and add export feature polish'
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Tested and working with no bugs found
  - Export feature now complete (Phase 4 of ExportFunctionPlan.md complete, Phase 5 skipped)
  - Full PDF intentionally removed - Excel recommended for 52-field export

### âœ… Align Type Definitions with CSSF Requirements (2025-10-30)
- **User Impact:** No user-facing changes. Internal code clarity improvement.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Modified `lib/types/supplier.ts` (removed 9 optional markers from mandatory fields per CSSF Circular 22/806)
  - Modified `lib/data/suppliers.ts` (updated dummy suppliers with missing required fields)
  - Modified `components/shared/forms/supplier-form.tsx` (added `|| ""` fallbacks for newly-required fields)
  - Type now accurately reflects CSSF requirements: all fields mandatory except `parentCompany`, `legalEntityIdentifier`, and conditional objects (`cloudService?`, `criticalFields?`, `subOutsourcing?`)
- **Validation Change:** NO - `check-completeness.ts` logic unchanged; type now matches existing validation requirements
- **Architecture Change:** NO - No structural or architectural changes
- **Commit:** d937da6 "align lib/types/supplier.ts with CSSF mandatory field requirements"
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Additional Notes:** Build: 0 TypeScript errors. All tests passing (draft save, edit, duplicate, display). This improves code maintainability and makes export function implementation cleaner by removing need for defensive checks on guaranteed-to-exist fields.
