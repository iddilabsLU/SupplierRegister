# Completed Documentation Updates Archive

**Purpose:** This file archives all features that have been processed by `/docs-sync` and incorporated into main documentation. It serves as a permanent project history.

**Archive Started:** 2025-10-28

---

## How This Works

1. User completes feature â†’ Runs `/log-update` â†’ Entry added to UPDATES.md
2. User accumulates 2-3 features â†’ Runs `/docs-sync`
3. Claude processes entries â†’ Updates CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, etc.
4. Claude moves processed entries here with timestamp
5. UPDATES.md is cleared (except in-progress items)

This file grows over time and provides:
- Complete project history
- Reference for what was built when
- Context for understanding documentation changes
- Audit trail of feature completions

---

## Archive Format

Entries are organized by sync date (when documentation was updated), not feature completion date.

```
## Documentation Sync: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Features Processed:** [count]
- **Documentation Updated:** [files updated]
- **Sync Duration:** [time taken]

[Feature entries moved from UPDATES.md]
```

### âœ… Edit Supplier Feature (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Users can edit existing suppliers from the register table by clicking the Edit button. The form opens with all fields pre-filled, reference number is locked, and pending fields are preserved. After saving, changes override the previous supplier data in the table.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Modified `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (added edit state, handleEditSupplier, handleUpdateSupplier handlers)
  - Modified `supplier-register-table.tsx` (added onEdit prop, wired Edit button to call parent handler)
  - Modified `supplier-form.tsx` (activated mode prop, updated toast messages for edit/add modes, simplified cancel dialog)
  - Modified `form-actions.tsx` (changed button text to "Update Supplier" when mode="edit")
  - Modified `supplier-form-basic-info.tsx` (passed mode prop to make reference number read-only)
  - Modified `form-text-input.tsx` (added disabled prop support)
- **Validation Change:** NO - Reused existing two-layer validation system without modifications
- **Architecture Change:** NO - Reused existing form component with conditional mode prop
- **Commit:** Not committed yet (changes in working directory)
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Reference number field is read-only (disabled) in edit mode to prevent duplicates
  - Pending fields are preserved from original supplier
  - Cancel dialog simplified to always show confirmation (cleaner UX)
  - Cloud/critical data clearing already existed (no changes needed)
  - All 10 test scenarios passed successfully

## Documentation Sync: 2025-10-28 (Final)

**Features Processed:** 3
**Documentation Updated:** CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md
**Sync Duration:** ~5 minutes

### âœ… SessionStorage Data Persistence (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Changes to suppliers (add, edit, delete) now persist when refreshing the page. Data survives refreshes during the session but resets to default when the browser tab is closed, providing a clean demo experience.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Created `lib/utils/session-storage.ts` (save/load/clear supplier utilities)
  - Created `hooks/use-session-storage.ts` (React hook with automatic persistence on state changes)
  - Created `components/shared/demo-banner.tsx` (dismissible banner explaining demo mode)
  - Modified `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (integrated useSessionStorage hook)
  - Modified `components/shared/supplier-register-table.tsx` (changed table hint banner from localStorage to sessionStorage for consistency)
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (added utility layer, no structural changes)
- **Commit:** a01dffb4 "feature: Add sessionStorage data persistence for supplier register"
- **Docs Updated:** CLAUDE.md (added to What Works), ROADMAP.md (marked as Done)

### âœ… Delete Supplier Functionality (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Users can now delete suppliers from the register table. Clicking the delete button shows a confirmation dialog with supplier details, and upon confirmation, the supplier is permanently removed from the list. Changes persist across page refreshes during the session.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Added `handleDeleteSupplier` function in `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (filters suppliers by reference number)
  - Wired `onDelete` prop to `SupplierRegisterTable` component
  - Fixed toast notification in `components/shared/supplier-register-table.tsx` (moved outside if/else to always show)
  - Delete functionality integrates with existing sessionStorage persistence (auto-saves)
  - Confirmation dialog and toast notification already existed, just needed wiring
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (used existing UI components and state patterns)
- **Commit:** 813d3ca "feature: Implement delete supplier functionality"
- **Docs Updated:** CLAUDE.md (added to What Works), ROADMAP.md (marked as Done)

### âœ… Instant Duplicate Supplier (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Users can now instantly duplicate any supplier by clicking the Duplicate button. A new supplier is created with an auto-generated reference number, Draft status, and all original fields preserved (including dates and pending fields). A toast notification confirms the action.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Added `handleDuplicateSupplier` function in `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (clones supplier data, generates new reference, sets status to Draft)
  - Added `toast` import from sonner library
  - Wired `onDuplicate` prop to `SupplierRegisterTable` component
  - Duplicate is added directly to suppliers array (no form redirect, stays on register list)
  - Toast notification shows: "Supplier duplicated - Created {newRef} based on {originalRef}"
  - Changes auto-persist via sessionStorage
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (reused existing patterns and state management)
- **Commit:** 778f14b "feature: Implement instant duplicate supplier functionality"
- **Docs Updated:** CLAUDE.md (added to What Works), ROADMAP.md (marked as Done)
