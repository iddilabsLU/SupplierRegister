# Pending Documentation Updates

**Purpose:** This file tracks completed features that need to be incorporated into main documentation (CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, etc.). It is maintained by Claude Code via the `/log-update` slash command.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28 (Synced: Documentation updated, entries archived)

---

## Instructions for Claude Code

When `/log-update` is run:
1. Read the most recent git commit(s) automatically
2. Analyze what files changed and what code changed
3. Ask user: "What does this feature do for users?" (non-technical description)
4. Determine automatically:
   - Whether validation logic changed (check lib/validations/, lib/utils/check-completeness.ts)
   - Whether architecture changed (new folders, components, data flow patterns)
   - Which documentation files need updating (CLAUDE.md always, others conditionally)
5. Write structured entry below using the template format
6. Use status markers: ‚úÖ COMPLETED, üöß IN PROGRESS, ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED

When `/docs-sync` is run:
1. Process all ‚úÖ COMPLETED items
2. Move them to COMPLETED.md with timestamp
3. Clear this file (keep only üöß IN PROGRESS and ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED items)

---

## Status Markers

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Feature is done and working, ready to document
- üöß **IN PROGRESS** - Feature partially implemented, provides context for next conversation
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **BLOCKED** - Feature started but blocked by decision/issue, not ready to document

## Notes for User

- Run `/log-update` after completing each feature (1-2 min)

- You don't need to edit this file manually - Claude maintains it
- If conversation ends mid-feature, üöß IN PROGRESS items preserve context
