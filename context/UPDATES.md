# Pending Documentation Updates

**Purpose:** This file tracks completed features that need to be incorporated into main documentation (CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, etc.). It is maintained by Claude Code via the `/log-update` slash command.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28 (Synced: Documentation updated, entries archived)

---

## Instructions for Claude Code

When `/log-update` is run:
1. Read the most recent git commit(s) automatically
2. Analyze what files changed and what code changed
3. Ask user: "What does this feature do for users?" (non-technical description)
4. Determine automatically:
   - Whether validation logic changed (check lib/validations/, lib/utils/check-completeness.ts)
   - Whether architecture changed (new folders, components, data flow patterns)
   - Which documentation files need updating (CLAUDE.md always, others conditionally)
5. Write structured entry below using the template format
6. Use status markers: ‚úÖ COMPLETED, üöß IN PROGRESS, ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED

When `/docs-sync` is run:
1. Process all ‚úÖ COMPLETED items
2. Move them to COMPLETED.md with timestamp
3. Clear this file (keep only üöß IN PROGRESS and ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED items)

---

## Status Markers

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Feature is done and working, ready to document
- üöß **IN PROGRESS** - Feature partially implemented, provides context for next conversation
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **BLOCKED** - Feature started but blocked by decision/issue, not ready to document

<!-- These will be processed by /docs-sync and moved to COMPLETED.md -->

### ‚úÖ Excel Export Functionality (2025-10-31)
- **User Impact:** Users can now export the supplier register to Excel with three options:
  - **Compact view** - Summary export with 8 key columns
  - **Full view** - Complete export with all 52 CSSF-compliant fields
  - **Filtered view** - Export only the filtered results from current search/filters
- **Technical Details:**
  - Created `export-dialog.tsx` (modal with scope + format options)
  - Created `export-button.tsx` (toolbar button to trigger export)
  - Created `lib/utils/export-excel.ts` (Excel generation using SheetJS)
  - Created `lib/utils/export-field-mapping.ts` (complete 52-field CSSF mapping - 548 lines)
  - Created `lib/utils/export-formatters.ts` (data transformation utilities for dates, booleans, arrays)
  - Integrated export button into `supplier-register-table.tsx` toolbar
  - Added `xlsx` package for Excel generation
  - Added `jspdf` + `jspdf-autotable` dependencies (for future PDF export)
  - Smart handling: Pending fields marked with `*`, Cloud/Critical fields show "N/A" when not applicable, arrays formatted with commas/pipes
  - **Added "Activities are sub-outsourced" field (Yes/No toggle) for critical suppliers:**
    - Added `hasSubOutsourcing` boolean to 9 files (types, validation, form, display, export mapping, completeness check)
    - Replaced plain Switch with proper FormRadioGroup in critical form
    - Updated field count from 51‚Üí52 fields (21 critical fields now)
    - Toggle controls whether subcontractor array fields are shown/required
- **Validation Change:** YES - Added `hasSubOutsourcing` validation logic (checks toggle first, then subcontractor array if Yes)
- **Architecture Change:** NO - New export utilities added, but no major structural changes
- **Commit:** 54b67be 'Feature implemented: export excel function both compact and full view, phase 1 - 3 of the exprotfunctionplan.md.'
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, VALIDATION.md
- **Additional Notes:**
  - Tested and working with no bugs found
  - Part of `ExportFunctionPlan.md` implementation (Phase 1-3 complete)
  - Phase 4-5 (PDF export) pending - button placeholder exists in dialog
  - ARCHITECTURE.md already updated in commit with export section

### ‚úÖ Align Type Definitions with CSSF Requirements (2025-10-30)
- **User Impact:** No user-facing changes. Internal code clarity improvement.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Modified `lib/types/supplier.ts` (removed 9 optional markers from mandatory fields per CSSF Circular 22/806)
  - Modified `lib/data/suppliers.ts` (updated dummy suppliers with missing required fields)
  - Modified `components/shared/forms/supplier-form.tsx` (added `|| ""` fallbacks for newly-required fields)
  - Type now accurately reflects CSSF requirements: all fields mandatory except `parentCompany`, `legalEntityIdentifier`, and conditional objects (`cloudService?`, `criticalFields?`, `subOutsourcing?`)
- **Validation Change:** NO - `check-completeness.ts` logic unchanged; type now matches existing validation requirements
- **Architecture Change:** NO - No structural or architectural changes
- **Commit:** d937da6 "align lib/types/supplier.ts with CSSF mandatory field requirements"
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Additional Notes:** Build: 0 TypeScript errors. All tests passing (draft save, edit, duplicate, display). This improves code maintainability and makes export function implementation cleaner by removing need for defensive checks on guaranteed-to-exist fields.

## Notes for User

- Run `/log-update` after completing each feature (1-2 min)
- Run `/docs-sync` when you have 2-3 completed features (5-10 min weekly)
- You don't need to edit this file manually - Claude maintains it
- If conversation ends mid-feature, üöß IN PROGRESS items preserve context
