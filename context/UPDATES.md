# Pending Documentation Updates

**Purpose:** This file tracks completed features that need to be incorporated into main documentation (CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, etc.). It is maintained by Claude Code via the `/log-update` slash command.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28

---

## Instructions for Claude Code

When `/log-update` is run:
1. Read the most recent git commit(s) automatically
2. Analyze what files changed and what code changed
3. Ask user: "What does this feature do for users?" (non-technical description)
4. Determine automatically:
   - Whether validation logic changed (check lib/validations/, lib/utils/check-completeness.ts)
   - Whether architecture changed (new folders, components, data flow patterns)
   - Which documentation files need updating (CLAUDE.md always, others conditionally)
5. Write structured entry below using the template format
6. Use status markers: ‚úÖ COMPLETED, üöß IN PROGRESS, ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED

When `/docs-sync` is run:
1. Process all ‚úÖ COMPLETED items
2. Move them to COMPLETED.md with timestamp
3. Clear this file (keep only üöß IN PROGRESS and ‚è∏Ô∏è BLOCKED items)

---

## Status Markers

- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Feature is done and working, ready to document
- üöß **IN PROGRESS** - Feature partially implemented, provides context for next conversation
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **BLOCKED** - Feature started but blocked by decision/issue, not ready to document

## Recent Completions

<!-- Claude Code: Add completed features here via /log-update -->
<!-- These will be processed by /docs-sync and moved to COMPLETED.md -->

### ‚úÖ SessionStorage Data Persistence (2025-10-28)
- **User Impact:** Changes to suppliers (add, edit, delete) now persist when refreshing the page. Data survives refreshes during the session but resets to default when the browser tab is closed, providing a clean demo experience.
- **Technical Details:**
  - Created `lib/utils/session-storage.ts` (save/load/clear supplier utilities)
  - Created `hooks/use-session-storage.ts` (React hook with automatic persistence on state changes)
  - Created `components/shared/demo-banner.tsx` (dismissible banner explaining demo mode)
  - Modified `app/suppliers/page.tsx` (integrated useSessionStorage hook)
  - Modified `components/shared/supplier-register-table.tsx` (changed table hint banner from localStorage to sessionStorage for consistency)
- **Validation Change:** NO
- **Architecture Change:** NO (added utility layer, no structural changes)
- **Commit:** a01dffb4 "feature: Add sessionStorage data persistence for supplier register"
- **Docs to Update:** CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md
- **Additional Notes:** All banners now use sessionStorage for dismissal (reset on tab close). Successfully tested: add/edit persist on refresh, delete pending implementation, data resets on tab close.

## Notes for User

- Run `/log-update` after completing each feature (1-2 min)
- Run `/docs-sync` when you have 2-3 completed features (5-10 min weekly)
- You don't need to edit this file manually - Claude maintains it
- If conversation ends mid-feature, üöß IN PROGRESS items preserve context

**Next Action:** Run `/log-update` after your next feature completion
